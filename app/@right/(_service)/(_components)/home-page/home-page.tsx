        "Aifa is highly optimized for cost-efficiency and performance. It connects directly to AI services without intermediaries for minimal token costs, uses Redis for server resource optimization, and implements static generation to reduce database queries. Services like Neon Database, Vercel Blob storage, and Vercel hosting offer generous free tiers perfect for MVP launches. OpenAI Vector Store provides 1GB of free data storage. When you reach enterprise scale, you can always migrate from cloud to dedicated servers.",

      question: "What are the real costs to launch this project?",
      answer:
        "$5 is the minimum payment required to acquire an OpenAI API key. There are no hidden fees or subscriptions in this project. You get 100% source code access to the entire project. Unlike similar projects that offer limited access while keeping features behind proprietary APIs, Aifa provides complete transparency. Every component is documented and the AI model is trained to explain how each component works and how to modify it for your specific needs. Your total launch cost is just $5 - nothing more.",

      answer:
        "Absolutely yes! This project serves as a live demonstration of Aifa capabilities. Currently, this presentation runs on AI SDK v4, and I'm actively adding new tutorial pages where I'm building this project from scratch using v5. The tutorial will be completed soon, and the entire project will be fully upgraded to the fifth version.",

      id: "faq-8",
      question: "Is this project an attempt to create another V0?",

        "Not exactly. This project has a specific design philosophy from the start - the Aifa standard with chatbot on the left and application on the right, plus built-in powerful authentication, API gateway, and many other pre-built components. While this adds some constraints, it provides a ready-made architecture that's much easier to complete by creating just a few components. If you're asking whether you can write code and create components directly in this chat - some things are already possible, but I'm working to enable much more. My ultimate goal is to allow every developer to create AI agents during development that can not only help them write code, but also be useful to other programmers using the same technology stack and similar package.json configurations.",

        "My goal is to launch autonomous AI agents within this project by the end of 2025. Any developer can train these agents to match their coding style for solving specific tasks. AI agent knowledge will accumulate on the platform, eventually enabling something similar to AGI. This part is in early prototyping stages, but I'm confident this approach will create a v0 analog with a significant difference: while v0 relies solely on its model's knowledge for programming solutions, Aifa AGI will orchestrate AI agents that already have successful development experience with similar technology stacks.",
